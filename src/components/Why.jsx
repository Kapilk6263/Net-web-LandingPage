        Our Mission is simple, create opportunities for entrepreneurs and small businesses by providing easily accessible tools, resources, and networks designed to connect, promote, and grow a business. Our vision of creating an economic market where small businesses and entrepreneurs thrive was created by NetVest partners Michelle Haines, Marcus Haines, and Tamica Mickle. As small business owners and corporate executives, the challenges, and barriers of establishing, growing, and then scaling a small business prompted the vision of NetVest. After reflecting on the multiple rejections, denials, and hurdles to obtain financial resources, access to connections, and guidance for proper paperwork and filings; the NetVest founders determined something needed to be done to level the playing field.

       CEO Michelle Haines and COO Tamica Mickle also bring their corporate executive experience to NetVest and envision the organization being one that embraces its social corporate responsibility to create a positive impact on the current and future communities and generations of entrepreneurs.
